## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   An API was developed using the MSC (model-service-controller) architecture.

-   The built API is a sales management system in dropshipping format in which it will be possible to create, visualize, delete and update products and sales. The MySQL database was used for data management, along with Docker. Furthermore, the API is RESTful.

## Skills used:

-   Node.js
-   Express
-   MySQL
-   Docker
-   Mocha
-   Otherwise
-   Chai

# Mandatory Requirements

## 01 - Create endpoints to list products

-   The endpoint for listing products must be accessible via the path (`/products`) e (`/products/:id`);
-   through the way`/products`, all products must be returned;
-   through the way`/products/:id`, only the product with the`id`present in the URL must be returned;
-   The result of the listing must be**tidy**growing across the field`id`;

<details close>
  <summary>Os seguintes pontos ser√£o avaliados</summary>

-   **[It will be validated that it is possible to list all products]**

    -   When successfully listing users the result returned should be as shown below, with an http status`200`:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Martelo de Thor"
